# Rnet
In a nutshell, Peer-to-peer application deployment framework.
## Why peer-to-peer?
* Decentralization
* Information Privacy
* That's what i think the Internet should be
## Design Overview
p2p is a well-known term in many scenarios, referring to the connections among peers directly. The design of p2p systems are also well researched and deployed, therefore Rnet is nothing technically novel. I consider Rnet to be a connector, that allows the possibility to bring different programs from different developers into a collaborative platform. The challenge lies on how to design a set of univeral interfaces that allows heterogeneity without losing creativity.
Any node in Rnet system will function as a server as well as a client like many other p2p systems do. So, let's discuss them as separate part of the system.
### Server
* Routing
* Security and Identity Check
* Services
### Client
* Software
* OS mediator
* Fancy UI
